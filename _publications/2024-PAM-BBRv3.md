excerpt: "The third version of the Bottleneck-Bandwidth and Round-trip (BBR) algorithm, BBRv3, is now the default CCA for all public Internet traffic from google.com and YouTube. This work builds upon prior research to examine BBRv3's ability to coexist with Cubic flows by taking loss, in the form of explicit congestion notification (ECN) signals, into account. Our evaluations reveal that, when ECN is enabled, a single BBRv3 flow can acquire more than ~99% of the bandwidth even when competing with five Cubic flows. These findings have crucial implications for using BBRv3 in the public Internet."
