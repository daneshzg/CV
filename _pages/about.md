I am a PhD student at the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Informatik, working under the supervision of [Prof. Anja Feldmann](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/inet/people/anja-feldmann) and [Dr. Balakrishnan Chandrasekaran](https://balakrishnanc.github.io/). My doctoral work focuses on investigating congestion-control algorithm (CCA) designs, particularly by exploiting rich and novel signals from the network.
